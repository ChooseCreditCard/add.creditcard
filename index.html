          Many people carry two or more credit cards. This page explains why, what can go right,
          what can go wrong, and how to think about adding a card as part of a small, controlled
          card portfolio instead of just “more plastic”.

    <!-- Overview -->
    <section id="overview" class="section">
      <h2>What Does It Mean to “Add” a Credit Card?</h2>
      <p>
        Adding a card usually means applying for an additional credit card when you already
        hold at least one. You might:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>keep your first card and add a second for travel or rewards,</li>
        <li>add a card with different features (no foreign fees, better insurance), or</li>
        <li>add a backup card in case your primary one fails or is compromised.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From the bank’s perspective, each new card is a new account with its own limit,
        terms and risk profile. From your perspective, it should be a deliberate decision
        about <strong>function</strong>, not just another line of credit.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Reasons -->
    <section id="reasons" class="section">
      <h2>Common Reasons People Add a Second or Third Card</h2>
      <p>
        There are several rational reasons to add another card, if you can keep control over
        spending and payments:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Feature gap:</strong> your current card may lack travel insurance, lounge access,
          0% FX, or good rewards on specific categories.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Separation of spend:</strong> one card for travel, one for everyday, one for
          business or side projects to keep accounting cleaner.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Backup and resilience:</strong> having a second network (e.g. Visa + Mastercard)
          can help if one card or network fails during a trip.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Building a profile:</strong> more total available credit, used responsibly,
          can sometimes improve utilization ratios over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The key is that each additional card should have a <strong>clear job</strong> in your setup.
        If you cannot explain why a new card earns its place, “adding” can quickly turn into noise.
      </p>

    <!-- Risks -->
    <section id="risks" class="section">
      <h2>Risks of Adding Cards – and How to Stay in Control</h2>
      <p>
        Extra cards mean extra moving parts. Before applying, consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>More credit, more temptation:</strong> higher total limits can make it easier
          to overspend if you do not track balances closely.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multiple due dates:</strong> several statements and payment dates increase
          the risk of missed payments and late fees.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Annual fees stacking:</strong> multiple fee-based cards can reduce the net
          value of any perks or rewards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Hard inquiries:</strong> each new application can temporarily affect your
          credit file, depending on jurisdiction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A simple control is to treat each card as part of a small “toolbox”: limit how many tools
        you own, write down what each one is for, and close cards that no longer earn their place
        after you have checked potential impacts on your credit history.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Portfolio-thinking -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Designing a Small, Purpose-Built Card Portfolio</h2>
      <p>
        Instead of adding cards randomly, think in terms of a <strong>portfolio</strong> with roles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>One strong everyday card for local purchases.</li>
        <li>One travel-focused card for foreign currency and trips.</li>
        <li>Optionally, one niche card for a specific loyalty program or benefit.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anything beyond that should have a very clear case: an unusually strong benefit, a
        specific temporary goal, or a niche use-case. If not, adding complexity may not be
        worth the mental load.
