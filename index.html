        Add.creditcard explains what happens when you “add” something in the card world – extra
        cardholders, add-on cards, virtual numbers, wallets and connected accounts – and how this affects
        fees, limits, security and liability.

    <!-- What is “add” in card terms? -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>What does “add” mean for a credit card?</h2>
      <p class="small">
        “Add” appears in many places in card journeys: add a new cardholder, add a virtual card, add your
        card to a wallet, add the card to a merchant account, or add a card to a family or business pool.
        Each “add” changes how the card can be used – and who is responsible.
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>Additional cardholders</strong> – extra physical or virtual cards linked to the same account.</li>
        <li><strong>Add-on cards</strong> – cards issued for family members, employees or partners with shared credit.</li>
        <li><strong>Wallet &amp; device tokens</strong> – adding your card to Apple Pay, Google Pay, wearables and apps.</li>
        <li><strong>Linked accounts &amp; merchants</strong> – storing card details with platforms, subscriptions and marketplaces.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        Done well, this makes cards much more useful. Done poorly, it can increase fraud exposure, confusion
        about who owes what, and surprise fees.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- How it works -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>How adding cardholders &amp; cards actually works</h2>
      <p class="small">
        The mechanics behind adding cardholders or linking cards follow a few consistent steps:
      </p>
      <ul class="list">
        <li><strong>1. Identity &amp; eligibility</strong> – issuers check who is allowed to be an additional
          cardholder (age, relationship, region, KYC rules).</li>
        <li><strong>2. Linking to the main account</strong> – add-on cards share a credit line or spend limit
          with the primary cardholder or business account.</li>
        <li><strong>3. Card issuance</strong> – new physical or virtual card numbers are generated, often with
          their own PAN and expiry but shared backend account.</li>
        <li><strong>4. Controls &amp; limits</strong> – per-card or per-user limits, merchant category blocks,
          and alerts may be configured.</li>
        <li><strong>5. Statements &amp; reporting</strong> – spend is either merged into one statement or split
          by user/card for transparency.</li>
        <li><strong>6. Wallet &amp; token binding</strong> – when added to a wallet, the card is tokenized and
          linked to specific devices and authentication methods.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="small">
        From a risk perspective, each new card, token or linked account is another potential point of misuse –
        which is why limits, alerts and role definitions are so important.
      </p>

    <!-- Types / models -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Types of “add-on” and linked card models</h2>
      <p class="small">
        Not all “add” actions are the same. These are the most common models users and businesses encounter:
      </p>

      <div class="cluster-grid">
        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Family add-on cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Extra cards for partners or children, sharing the primary cardholder’s credit line. Useful for
            managing household spend, but the primary user usually remains fully liable.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Employee &amp; team cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Business cards issued to employees, often with per-user limits and expense tracking. Helps
            decentralise spend while keeping control centrally.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Virtual &amp; single-use cards</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Extra card numbers generated for online merchants or subscriptions. Limits and expiry can be
            tuned per merchant, reducing fraud and card-change pain.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Wallet &amp; wearable tokens</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Adding the card to Apple Pay, Google Pay or wearables. The underlying PAN is replaced by tokens,
            improving security and supporting tap-to-pay.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Platform &amp; merchant linking</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Storing card details with marketplaces, ride-hailing apps, delivery platforms or subscription
            services. Speeds up checkout but concentrates risk if an account is compromised.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cluster-card">
          <h3>Shared &amp; pooled accounts</h3>
          <p class="small">
            Multiple users share one balance or spending pool, sometimes with individual sub-limits and
            cards. Common in joint, family or corporate setups.
