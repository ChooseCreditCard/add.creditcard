    <h2>Why Add Another Credit Card?</h2>
    <p>
      Many people use more than one credit card to combine rewards, lower costs or access perks not available on a
      single product. One card might excel at travel earning, another at groceries, and a third offer no-fee foreign
      purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adding a new card can also diversify protections—insurance packages, purchase protections and extended warranties
      often differ between issuers and networks.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section id="mechanics" class="section">
    <h2>How Issuers Assess Additional Cards</h2>
    <p>
      When you apply for an extra card, issuers look at your existing accounts, payment history, credit utilisation and
      overall profile. Frequent on-time repayment across several cards can help; high utilisation or recent credit stress
      can work against you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some banks consider internal relationship factors as well—existing deposits, mortgage history or prior card
      performance may influence approval and limits.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Combining Multiple Cards Strategically</h2>
    <p>
      A multi-card setup usually follows one of three patterns:
    </p>
    <ul class="list">
      <li>• A “general + specialist” mix: one strong all-rounder plus category-boosters.</li>
      <li>• A “travel stack”: airline, hotel and premium travel card combined.</li>
      <li>• A “fee-optimised mix”: several no-fee cards that cover key categories.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The trick is spreading spend across cards intentionally rather than randomly—matching real purchase behaviour to
      the right reward structure.
    </p>
  </section>

  <section class="section">
    <h2>Downsides of Adding Too Many Cards</h2>
    <p>
      While multiple cards can be powerful, too many accounts may create complexity or increase the risk of missed
      payments. Annual fees across a large collection can also outweigh the benefits if not regularly reviewed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Issuers may also reduce limits if they see excessive new applications in a short period, even when approvals remain
      strong.
